description: 'Call variants for a cohort of samples. The typical command for new samples would be:\n\nbioco.py --base-dir <parent dir of data> --complete-pipeline -n <cores>'

help_texts:
    d: 'Base directory for the sequencer run (should contain a "data" subdirectory with the .fastq files). A "results" subdirectory will be created in it.'
    t: 'Trim adapters from the fastqs and create .trimmed.fastq R1 and R2 files for each sample.'
    a: 'Align reads to the reference genome and create a .bam file for each sample.'
    v: 'Create .vcf and .g.vcf files for each sample from the .bam.'
    j: 'Do a joint genotyping for the cohort.'
    f: 'Do a hard filtering on the .vcf files. The parameters will be read from ~/.biocodices/parameters.yml'
    c: 'Go through all the steps of the pipeline. This is equivalent of passing the multi flag -tavjf'
    s: 'Analyze only these samples (separate their IDs with a comma and no spaces), skip the rest. If the joint-genotyping step is included in the analysis, it will be performed only with the chosen samples (the joint GVCF will not include them!). E.g.: -s SAMPLE001,SAMPLE002'
    k: 'Skip these samples (separate their IDs with a comma and no spaces), analyze the rest. If the joint-genotyping step is included in the analysis, it will be performed without the chosen samples (the joint GVFC will not include them!). E.g.: -k SAMPLE001,SAMPLE002'
    m: 'Generate and plot alignment and coverage metrics'
    n: 'Number of max simultaneous processes to spawn in some parts of the pipeline that have been parallelized (e.g. the HaplotypeCaller slow process).'
